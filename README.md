# Blue Armadillo

This project is based off of the https://github.com/alejaxdro/UNF_SD_BA_Code repository which allows control of a Sphero Style robot.
It is rewritten with cpp classes for motor control and PID magnetic north tracking for navigation. (NOTE: not sure if PID was pushed, fix that please)

This project does not have the networking/control software and does not have the audio control software from the original project.

Devices used:
- Beaglebone Black
- Roboclaw Motor Controller
- Pololu 9axis sensor
